            <h1>About MediConnect</h1>
        <p>MediConnect is a platform dedicated to connecting individuals in need of medical supplies with donors willing to help. Our mission is to facilitate quick and efficient connections to save lives during emergencies.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To provide a reliable and accessible platform that bridges the gap between those in need of medical assistance and those willing to donate, ensuring timely support in critical situations.</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Users can register as either requesters or donors. Requesters can post their needs for blood or medicine, while donors can browse requests and offer their assistance. The platform uses location-based services to connect users in close proximity for faster response times.</p>
